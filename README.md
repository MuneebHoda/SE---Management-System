# SE - Production Management System

## Abstract

The purpose of the project is to streamline the production management system of an existing business, (ZM Corporation). This project proposes a technical solution to improve ZM Corporation's production management to make it easier for them to go through the information and make informed decisions based on the information provided.

Additionally, the project would assess whether the current system should be moved to a different architecture, such as a web-based system, an ERP-based system, a native desktop app, etc. At its conclusion, the project would select an architecture and show how to execute it to meet the needs of ZM Corporation. A native desktop production management tool was determined to be the best course of action during the project's discovery and analysis phase. Multiple users would be able to access the system from various locations using the web-based solution and conduct commercial operations. This system would make it simple for the corporate office to access the most recent store information and carry out system maintenance tasks.

Managers would benefit greatly from the Production management system since it would make it easier for them to identify things that need to be ordered first. As a result, managers would spend significantly less time on production management tasks and considerably more time managing the day-to-day operations of the store. The store managers could also ask for the transfer of goods from nearby retailers to meet an urgent need. As a result, the company would experience improved customer service and customer happiness, which would raise its income.
